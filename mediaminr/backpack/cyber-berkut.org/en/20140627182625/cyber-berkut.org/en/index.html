<h3>26.06.2014 DDoS-attack on the Ukrainian "Russian radio"</h3>
<p>The journalists of the Ukrainian office of "Russian radio" bought and organized the transfer of military equipment to one of the units of the National Guard of Ukraine that is planned to be send to the East of Ukraine in the near future to take part in the punitive operation. In protest against the explicit support of the representatives of the national media community of "antiterrorist operation" against its own people CyberBerkut is conducting a DDoS-attack on the website www.rusradio.ua (11:30 26.06.2014)

<h3>25.06.2014 The address of CyberBerkut to the employees of mass-media of Ukraine</h3>
<p>We address to employees of mass-media of Ukraine - "Stop lying to the people". The degree of untruth about the situation in our country has exceeded all conceivable criteria. The people receive lies from Ukrainian TV and radio, printed media and national resources of the Internet. The journalists who are trying to bring a grain of truth to Ukrainians are losing their jobs immediately and often get to National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. Lies that are told by the Ukrainian media have already been recognized even in the USA which have its geopolitical interests and continue to play the master in Ukraine.<br>
Ukrainian journalists, you are lying to the people! Due to the nature of your work, you know the truth, but you are lying to please oligarchs and fascists who burst through to power (due to your lies) and you are working by theirs instructions. You're lying about the economic situation in Ukraine, you are covering war crimes of the junta and the Right Sector in the South-East, you are contributing to our oligarch rulers that sell Ukraine to Washington. But soon the black becomes white, and the people will curse you for your lies! You bear the responsibility for the current situation in Ukraine together with your oligarch masters.<br>
If you still have a little bit of conscience left in you, if you still remember the journalist's code of ethics, if you dislike that the Ukrainian media is called corrupt, say "NO" to lies and say the TRUTH to the people of Ukraine.

<h3>25.06.2014 CyberBerkut opposes the US diktat in the international area</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, know the aspirations of the common Ukrainians, hear their pleas for peace and see their readiness to choose the future of our country independently. However the US intervention in internal affairs of Ukraine that had been recognized openly by Barack Obama during his statement at the Military Academy at West Point led this country to the brink of extinction. In addition the US propaganda machine with the participation of their satellite countries in Europe provided international support to interventional policy of the "indispensable" state.<br>
Moreover the American president during his speech to newly-made officers declared that intervention in other states affairs (evidently "dispensable") is the inalienable right of the United States. Such statements should alert the partners of the superpower.<br>
We oppose the manipulation of public opinion and consider our duty to support the right of citizens of any state to have unrestricted access to unforbidden information regardless of the political commitment of their leadership. Therefore today we've launched the English version of our site.<br>
We, CyberBerkut, serve to the Ukrainian people and will not allow American intervention to violate interests of citizens of our country!

<h3>25.06.2014 CyberBerkut resumes its activity</h3>
<p>
We, CyberBerkut, report that we resume our fight against neo-Nazism and oligarchic power in Ukraine. The elected president of Ukraine had enough time to change the country's course to positive. But now it became clear that nothing will change. The new president and his government are just puppets of the USA and EU. The true rulers of Ukraine are Kolomoisky and neo-Nazis. They do not care about interests of Ukrainian people. They are only interested in money, Nazi ideas and how to please their US masters.<br>
In this situation it is impossible to remain indifferent, we should fight for the future of Ukraine by all possible means. We will continue to do it in cyberspace and will do everything to show the true face of the new Ukrainian leadership!

<h3>04.06.2014 The address of CyberBerkut</h3>
<p>The Kiev junta continues the genocide of the Ukrainian people. Dozens of civilians are being killed by aviation and artillery in the south-east of our country. Hundreds of elderly people and children have lost their homes. Schools, hospitals and kindergartens have been destroyed. Ukrainian media - editors and journalists are controlled by the Kiev junta, they fear for their lives and are forced to ignore the truth about the events in the south-east.<br>
We, CyberBerkut, open the section on our website dedicated to the crimes of the junta against the Ukrainian people. We will collect documentary evidence of crimes against the civilian population (videos of bombing residential areas, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, side numbers of equipment of the Ukrainian army that commits attacks and etc.). Please submit the evidence. The perpetrators will appear in "The people's Tribunal"!<br><br>
We appeal to the Ukrainian military personnel.<br><br>
The soldiers and officers of the armed forces of Ukraine!<br>
Today we, CyberBerkut, appeal to you to stop. The Kiev authority under the pretext of the anti-terrorist operation pulled you into the bloody carnage. You have been cheated. You are accomplices to war crimes committed by the Right Sector and the National Guard of Ukraine that are ready to do anything for the oligarchs' money. Do not become those mercenaries. You can prevent the killing of Ukrainian women and children, who never were terrorists!<br>
Soon someone will have to pay for the committed crimes against the peaceful population of the south-east, and we do not exclude that the Kiev junta will lay all responsibility on simple officers. Keep this in mind.<br><br>
We are CyberBerkut. We will not forget! We will not forgive!

<h3>04.06.2014 Recruitment in the CyberArmy continues</h3>
<p>We continue recruitment in the CyberArmy. Everyone who wishes to join us to fight against fascism and oligarchic regime in Ukraine can download special software from our website <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20140627182625/http://www.cyber-berkut.org/en/army.php'>http://cyber-berkut.org/army.php</a> that will allow you to implement DDoS-attacks on the websites of Kiev junta.<br>
We have modified this program, and now it works without errors!<br><br>

<h3>28.05.2014 Address to the press</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, get a lot of questions from Ukrainian and foreign journalists concerning events before and during Poroshenko's presidential elections in Ukraine. We generalized them and declare:<br>
We really hacked and destroyed the Information-Analytical System "Elections" of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission. We also deleted all the data and software from all PCs and servers, removed their backups not only of the CEC but of the local election commissions. Databases and their backups were removed and routers settings were reset. So we destroyed not only the system data but its network equipment that made possible to eliminate the net physically.<br>
We really hacked and destroyed the Information-Analytical System "Elections" of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission. We also deleted all the data and software from all PCs and servers, removed their backups not only of the CEC but of the local election commissions. Databases and their backups were removed and routers settings were reset. So we destroyed not only the system data but its network equipment that made possible to eliminate the net physically.<br>
The IAS "Elections" elimination operation proved the extremely low information and computer security level at the Ukrainian state departments. We have been implementing all our actions for 6 hours at night after we had been convinced by the GSM location that general CEC members and employees had gone home. There are a lot of "holes" in the vaunted American SOE Software program which is imposed on so called "countries of new democracy". Either low qualification programmers work at this company or the "holes" were left specially for remote control over the elections votes counting. <br>
We supposed the junta would deny everything and pretend that nothing had happened. That's why we've uploaded the detailed report about our actions and the hacking scheme. We have been amused that nobody from "free and independent" Ukrainian journalists had put any awkward question about this to Nalivaychenko, Okhendovsky, Usenko-Chernaya, Magera. Perhaps the journalists had been given appropriate directions. In addition the fact of hacking could be proved by a simple call to system administrators at the LECs. Some of them even posted tweets about problems but then were silenced.<br>
We did not hack the CEC website on May 25. We were inside of the system and were monitoring vain endeavors of the officials to restore it. But they failed.<br>
Besides that we have been concentrating on liquidation of the computer network of the Dnepropetrovsk region administration because it concerned us more at that moment. It's the junta headed by Kolomoisky that supported the Washington decision about Poroshenko to be a president.<br>
We affirm that all the Kiev junta official representatives' statements about viruses in the system, spies and arrested hackers is an outrageous lie. We, CyberBerkut, have destroyed the system by remote access without any help inside the CEC. Any specialized hacking hardware equipment hasn't been confiscated from so called hackers because this equipment doesn't exist.<br>
We confirm the table showing that Yarosh and Poroshenko had passed to the second round of the elections appeared on the official CEC site. The junta was demonstrating to the society not the official CEC site (IP – 195.230.157.53) but some its mirrors located on different IP addresses (5.149.125.5, 46.164.140.106, 62.149.12.160, 193.29.204.25, 193.109.8.55, 193.138.87.26) and their information was changing manually. The table with other elections results has been kept for 30 minutes. It would be better to ask Okhendovsky what it was.<br>
At the same time we, CyberBerkut, don't believe that the Ukrainian journalists didn't pay attention to the amazing coincidence of the elections and exit poll results. Such coincidence undoubtedly is a unique case in the histore of sociology.<br>
The extremely low results of Yarosh and Tyagnibok (2% in sum) are doubtful as well, especially taking account of the Maidan authority and result showed by "Svoboda" during the last elections. We also noticed that the other candidates almost didn't comment the elections results.<br>
All of it gives us reasons to affirm the elections were fake in order to make Poroshenko the head of state and to demonstrate "the European choice" of the Ukrainian people. "Free expression of the Ukrainian people" is a fake of the junta which will lead to the further collapse of our country!<br><br>
We are CyberBerkut! We will not forget! We will not forgive!

<h3>25.05.2014 Cyber-strike on NATO information resources</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, remind you that we declared cyber-war against Kiev junta. Unfortunately USA and NATO continue to support the criminal politicians' band that seized Kiev. That means not only advices but the information technologies. Incompetent NATO cyber-center in Tallinn tries to provide the information network security of government and Central Election Commission of Ukraine (CEC).<br>
Today we, CyberBerkut, have hacked NATO's official site again (www.nato.int) which must be protected by cyber-soldiers from Tallinn. We have been repeatedly teaching the NATO cyber-center. But evidently its chief colonel Suzik didn't learn the lesson. We present our apologies to the European taxpayers because the financing of such a cyber-center is very expensive. But the fact is that the European citizens' funds allocated for cyber-security are being wasted in vain as before.<br>
We, CyberBerkut, are ready to help the Euro-Atlantic structures in the organization of information security but only after the victory over the Kiev junta. We hope also for the sensible support of European citizens who sooner or later will stop supporting the neo-fascism in Ukraine.

<h3>25.05.2014 Dnepropetrovsk region administration computer network is destroyed, the </h3>
<h3 style="margin-top: -15px;">Central Election Committee continues lying.</h3>
<p>Today we, CyberBerkut, hacked and destroyed the internal computer network of the Dnepropetrovsk region administration.<br>
Kolomoisky's headquarters working on legitimization of the lawless Ukrainian presidential elections and adulteration of their results functioned there after we destroyed the Information-Analytical System "Elections".<br>
We, CyberBerkut, state exorbitant lie level of the junta during so called elections. The CEC, SSU, MIA and State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSIPU) lie through their teeth stating the Information-Analytical System "Elections" is operational!<br>
The lie of the SSU and SSSIPU about "the virus in the system" is disproved already by the Kaspersky Lab. The lie of the CEC "the system works in a standard mode" is disproved by Avakov. Attempts of the junta to disavow the statement of their Minister of the MIA do not stand up to criticism because it was done 12 hours later. It is the evidence of the impostors' confusion in Kiev and of their loss of control over the situation. They have already began a witch-hunt calling the names of the CEC "traitors". The atmosphere of fear and horror reigns among the CEC members and employees of the local election commissions; they are banned to give any comments about the situation. They are under control of fighters from the Right Sector and Maidan Self-defense.<br>
We, CyberBerkut, declare that we are inside the CEC network communications permanently. We affirm the system is not operational and the information exchange between the Center and regions goes by phones and employees' mail exclusively. Any attempts of the junta to prove the opposite are going to fail. They have nothing to show journalists except the imitation of the switched on computers.<br><br>
We are CyberBerkut! We will not forget! We will not forgive!

<h3>25.05.2014 Election Committees phones are blocked</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, declare the presidential elections held today by the Kiev junta are lawless! State criminals who accomplished the treacherous neo-Nazi coup try to imitate politicians and to play democracy with the elections. Professionals from the State Department and CIA instructed them well but nothing will come out of it. They wish to impose their will on everybody and to demonstrate their power but to tell the truth they have neither one nor the other.<br>
These elections are needed by oligarchs and neo-fascists to stay unpunished, it's the attempt to legitimate their illegality committed in February 22. We, CyberBerkut, announce today that participation in "the presidential elections" of the Kiev junta is a display of weakness and lack of will, a treachery of Ukraine!<br>
We have blocked phone numbers of farce organizers and their assistants as a sign of protest!<br><br>

<h3>25.05.2014 Access to confidential data of Kolomoisky's assistant has been gained!</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, have gained access to PC documents and hacked the e-mail of Alexey Salkoch, the assistant of I.Kolomosky.<br>
The information about Kolomoisky's financing of the National Guard battalions "Dnepr-1", "Donetsk-1", "Lugansk", special purpose patrol and inspection service "Artemovsky" has been found in these documents.<br>

Salkoch's e-mail contains autobiographies of corrupted MIA employees and accounts for communication equipment, clothing and equipment allowance, cold steel, medicines, meals for personnel and surveillance devices for roadblocks. There are also instructions and plans of seizing power by the Nazi movement Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National Self Defence and of support their candidate during the so-called "presidential elections".<br>

<h3>22.05.2014 The address of CyberBerkut – presidential elections in Ukraine</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, declare the forthcoming so called Ukrainian presidential elections ILLEGITIMATE.<br>
To conduct an election campaign while journalists are imprisoned and the candidates for president are beaten by fascists – is CYNICAL.<br>
To demand election from voters while the junta burns and poisons citizens that do not agree with its policy – is IMMORAL.<br>
To conduct the elections in the country torn by the civil war – is CRIMINAL.<br>
The anti-national junta is going to legalize itself performing a show called "the Ukrainian presidential elections" directed by the West.<br>
WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT! Let's say our resolute NO to this farce!<br>
We, CyberBerkut, call all our compatriots to boycott the criminal elections. You are free to choose your own methods of doing that. But the fascist regime in Kiev will not be able to profit by your vote to discharge its crimes.<br>
Cyberfighters! If you don't fight against fascism it means you support it! Expect our instructions.<br><br>
We are CyberBerkut! We will not forget! We will not forgive!

<h3>CyberBerkut warns against probable repetition of the tragedy in Odessa</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, report that the anti-fascist procession of the Volunteer Police of Odessa (Narodnaya Druzhina) will take place today at 1 pm in memory of the fallen. According to our information the fighters from the Right Sector (Pravy Sector) plan performing provocations which with the high degree of probability will lead to the widespread victims.<br>
In order to prevent violence and mass murders we informed local public prosecution bodies about this fact. However this information should be spread among citizens. Every resident should know about probable further developments and take necessary measures. Don't allow repetition of the tragedy of May 2.<br>
The people lost confidence in the law enforcement agencies for their collaboration with the Nazis.<br>
We will keep forever in our hearts the memory about the anti-fascist heroes burned alive and killed in Odessa on May 2, 2014!<br><br>

<h3>05.05.2014 Boycott against PrivatBank of Kolomoisky and Roshen production of Poroshenko</h3>
<p>The oligarch Kolomoisky through his PrivatBank assigns means for killing of the civilian residents. By this money he sponsors the fascists from Right Sector and the National Guard, supplies weapons for genocide of his own people. We, CyberBerkut, appeal to everybody who hates fascism to print and stick these flyers on every PrivatBank branch at your location. Money of Kolomoisky HAS a smell. The smell of blood.

<h3>29.04.2014 89 e-mails of the Lviv prosecutor have been hacked.</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, continue to struggle against the neo-fascist junta which made coup d'ȇtat and unleashed warfare against its own people in the South-East of Ukraine.<br>
Today we hacked 89 e-mails of the Lviv prosecutor and gained access to the colossal internal documentation. We’re sure this content won't disappoint even the most exacting readers. They could receive evidence that the prosecutors of Lviv violate the statutory Constitution of Ukraine and don't guard the law but the interests of fascists.<br><br>

But the most interesting document is the mail sent by the oligarch Kolomoisky to the current prosecutor of Lviv V.Gural. We became familiar attentively with this message and recommend all of you to do so because it's about planned coup d'ȇtat. Its members are: Admiral I.Tenyukh, First Deputy Minister of Defence B.Buts, the Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service V.Gvozd', the Head of The Main directorate of intelligence of the Ministry of Defence Y.Pavlov, the commander of the 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade of the Air Force of Ukraine Y.Machmur, The Military Representative to NATO for Ukraine General A.Petrenko. Today everybody understands that there are other traitors. They are ready to do anything to toady to their American masters.<br><br>

<h3>29.04.2014 NATO General's e-mail has been hacked. A military takeover is being planned in Ukraine.</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, address to the Ukrainian people!<br>
Today we got additional evidence of the junta helplessness in Kiev. Turchinov and his gang incurred already a loss without large scaled warfare against theirs own people. Undoubtedly, it's necessary to have "particular talents" to surrender several foreigners and three officers from the Alfa unit, to lose Konstantinovka, one helicopter and the plane. But Generals compensate the lack of the combat skills far from the battle line. They practice intrigues and plots in the corridors of power showing a very keen insight and pep. They understood that their time is passing and made a decision to get rid of Pastor and his clique, to prevent Poroshenko to get power and to make Tyagnibok a president. <br>
Today these plans were made known thanks to efforts of the hackers group Anonymous Ukraine. They hacked the e-mail of Igor Kolomoisky and got a funny message to his old friend Vladimir Gural, the prosecutor of Lviv. <br>
Following his basic vital principle "suckers should be tricked" the assigned by the junta the head of the Dnepropetrovsk region recommends making an unofficial data inspection about the planning plot headed by Admiral Tenyuh. He named and other plot members including The Military Representative to NATO for Ukraine General Petrenko. Evidence of the planning plot had been found in his correspondence as well.</p>

The correspondence shows that the murder of Sashko Bily had been planned by Avakov in exchange for his death so called government would betray the Berkut unit members to Yarosh.<br>
In addition the correspondence pointed out how illegitimate power cynically eliminates disliked journalists for example Konstantin Dolgov who was held over and removed in Kiev in April, 19.<br>

<h3>18.04.2014 CyberBerkut delivered a cyber-blow </h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, address to the people of Ukraine! Today in our country the fascist government urges the army on unleashing of the civil war and corrupt oligarchs use stolen money to fool people, to foment hysteria and mutual hatred in the country. Such actions threaten the national security and territorial integrity of Ukraine and will lead inevitably to the mass bloodshed. We, CyberBerkut, consider our duty to stop cynical lies and disinformation in Internet that use the traitors of our country to sink it in blood of the civilians.<br>
We, CyberBerkut, declare war on the junta in Kiev! Yesterday we executed a mass attack against the Internet resources controlled by the self-declared power and disconnected the DNS servers of the UA registrar, causing total paralyzing of the largest data center in Kiev.<br>
If the junta doesn't stop giving criminal commands we will continue disconnecting domain zones. In this case the country will die virtually and the map of the Internet will become the blank spot without lies.

<h3>08.04.2014 CyberBerkut addresses to the Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovitsch! </h3>
<p>Today the people in the South-East of Ukraine rose for the resolute fight against the oligarchs who perfidiously seized the power in our country, against corrupt politicians, outrage bandits and we, CyberBerkut, address to the Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovitsch! <br>
We want you to know there is absolute outrage in your country as well at the governmental cabinets and in the streets. The marginal group in Kiev divides power by "presidential elections" and enters into an agreement process with IMF. By such actions our country will economically depend on the West for decades . We want you know that if you had took more resolute measures in time and hadn't escaped the country, this entire situation in the country wouldn't be happened. <br>
How long do you plan staying in Russia? Do you really think that you could live the rest of your life like a successful businessman? But we want you to know that you will be the Escaped President for everybody forever. The President who saved himself and forgot about those who died for you. You deserted your people without rights and protection and the oligarchs, neo-Nazis and Euro-American politicians who continue violence in Ukraine. <br>
But you can stop this lawlessness. You must come back to our country in Donetsk or Kharkiv where you'll be in safety and perform your duty to the people. So called legitimacy of the junta in Kiev will burst like a soap-bubble because Ukraine will have the constitutional President! Your return will boost the holding of the nationwide referendum and destroy the preparing elections in Kiev! <br>
You have grandsons. What will you answer their questions? Why do they live in exile and can't repatriate? What did you do to prevent poverty, chaos and fascist march in your country? Do you not really care that they will be shamed of their surname "Yanukovitsch"?<br>
We call you to return and officially give power those who are trusted by people's fate. <br><br>

We will protect our country from traitors and neo-fascists!<br>

<p>We, CyberBerkut, continue our fighting against the anti-national Kiev regime. <br>
New government which seized power by neo-Nazis took the road of the lie to get the legitimate status and an approval of the EU and the USA. In order to hide the killing of special squad soldiers and their own Right Sector members they blamed Berkut soldiers by their media. Puppeteers from the West applaud to their capable pupils. To do anything by proxy is so American! This is a true democracy! They don't care about people blood and sorrow, geopolitical success is above all. They even told the EU to go to hell. The henchmen of the West are ready to do anything including lying to the people by mass media.

<h3>22.03.2014 How the USA organized the brown revolution in Ukraine</h3>
<p>The correspondence between the Ukrainian NGOs, the U.S. embassy and American funds had been hacked.<br>
We, CyberBerkut, as promised continue our exposures of the Ukrainian traitors. Today we present the hacked e-mail correspondence of Eduard Egorov – the chairman of the board at the non-governmental organization "Educational Center of Human Rights", which took part in the recent months' events. <br>
The correspondence shows that the National Endowment for Democracy which is given money by the U.S. Congress directly and promotes "the American democracy" around the world was responsible for immediate funding of the revolution process in Ukraine.<br>
And the department of press, education and culture of the U.S. embassy as it turned out was responsible for the Ukrainian traitors' efforts coordination in Maidan. It's funny that even the education and culture department in the American embassy is occupied with planting of "the brown plague" in Ukraine, isn't it?<br>
We urgently recommend everybody to make a careful study of these downloaded documents. They demonstrate the support schemes and coup d'état funding in Ukraine.<br>
Here are the links on archives:<br><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140627182625/http://www.cyber-berkut.org/docs/best.7z">Interesting selection</a><br>

As you can see the NGO traitors are ready to do anything even to sell their Motherland in order to get newly printed money from the ocean. Read how these Judas report back to their master on the work they had done. <br><br>
Here is the part of the traitors and their adherents' list:<br><br>
Boris Kudar, Eduard Egorov, Vladimir Trandafil, Sergey Averkov, Yuriy Chudnovsky, W. Michael Davis, Alexandr Sidorenko, Andrey Yuzvenko, Alicia Wondoloski, Benjamin Morano, Yuriy Didula, Sergey Suhoboychenko, Viacheslav Golovchenko, Nicolay Vorobev, Anton Chernysh, Oleg Konotoptsev, Zinaida Glushko, Taras Plakhtiy, Konstantin Zayats, Vyacheslav Konovalov, Anastasiya Konstantinovs`ka, Aleks Fom, Vladimr Volikov, Artem Reshetilov, Roman Huzyakhmetov, Jennifer Lynn Viau, Andrey Eremenko, Vadim Melnikov, Tatyana Podobinskaia-Shtyk, Vitaliy Makarenko, Yuriy Koss, Aleksey Pilipchuk, Helena Zhadko, Nicolay Mokrik, Katerina Avramchuk, Kristina Shira, Anastasiya Zhukova, Mihail Chukhno, Vladimir Moroz, Yuriy Bogdanov, Tatyana Barabolikova, Victoria Kuziva, Yuliya Fedorova, Anna Lopushanska, Ekaterina Sorochenko, Andrey Ozhishchenko, Mark Borzenkov, Lyudmila Zlobina, Ekaterina Ponomarenko, Irina Paleta, Vladimir Rogozhin, Helena Bershtein, Joanna Rohozinska, Yuliya Gonchar, Irina Taran, Natalia Zabrots`ka, Andrey Yuzvenko, Agnieszka Gmys-Wiktor, Olga Litvin, Jacek Gralczyk, Valeriy Bezushko, Anna Tkach, Roman Basaliga, Vladimir Panchenko, Irina Patronik, Dmitriy Batyuk, Kirill Stremousov, Maria Gudovanaya, Elena Kovtun, Olga Briga, Nadezhda Rakitina, Sergey Reshetov, Irina Los`, David Meilfant, Diana Epshtein, Tatyana Baeva, V.

Following the ask of the Kiev junta a student group in Ukraine which named itself Cybersotnya (Cyberhundred) conducts its activity headed by NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn. Using them as a cover the West implements active propaganda activity among the Ukrainian population by mass media and social networks, blocks unbiased information sources and protect the criminals named themselves "legal power".<br>
The whole elite of the NATO cyber leadership arrived to help idiots from Maidan (maidiots) headed by Colonel Artur Suzik. <br>

<h3>13.03.2014 The e-mails of the UDAR and Bat'kivschina parties have been hacked</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, as the most people of Ukraine do not agree with the policy of the self-styled reigns headed by the Right Sector radicals. Some named themselves the Prime Minister, the Acting President, the others even dream of the President's office. But in real life they are political traitors performing shady dealings following their private interests. Even today they remove from the political arena probable rivals and soon they will bite each other's head off.<br>
We don't agree with such situation and will fight against this by any ways, against these "people leaders" and their pocket parties. We've hacked the e-mails of the UDAR party in Lviv, Lugansk, Khmel'nitsk, Donetsk and of the Bat'kivschina party in Lugansk. There are many interesting documents in it for the Ukrainian community. We were promised the most honest elections in the Ukrainian history however pay your attention to one of the UDAR documents. They do trolling but it is cheating indeed! And after these elections they will forget about people interests at all. They will feed oligarchs and Right Sector who gave them power. <br><br>

<h3>06.03.2014 Our regards to Yatsenyuk and Timoshenko!</h3>
<p>We, CyberBerkut, announce that political traitors who seized power in Kiev by the neo-fascist takeover went way too far in their treachery today. We learnt the new regime does everything for our country to be occupied by NATO troops, U.S. private military companies and to become U.S anti-missile defense deployment area. They must haven't heard us but we were ready. Yatsenyuk and Timoshenko, did you like the phone conversation record between the Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Catherine Ashton? Be ready for much bigger surprises! <br>
We, CyberBerkut announce that we interrupted the countdown and passed from words to deeds due to sharp deterioration of the socio-political situation in Ukraine, gross violations of the Constitution, country laws and the inalienable rights and freedoms of citizens.<br>
You, Yatsenyuk, Klichko, Tyagnibok and conditional early discharged Timoshenko, lost your chance and would be given no quarter. You had an opportunity saving yourself and preventing the tragedy extension in Ukraine, but you wanted to hide from your people behind NATO soldiers' backs. We, CyberBerkut, won't permit you to do so. We will help Ukraine to save the independent from the Western aggression which is ready to protect the neo-fascist government.<br>

<p>The people of Ukraine!<br><br>
Today our capital is occupied by fascists! Corrupted politics use them to seize power in country by any way. They also use those who still believe in fairy tales about happy and carefree life in Europe. All these Yatsenyuks and Klichkos don't think about ordinary people and are not going to do their life better. While the "revolutionary masses" wait for manna from new rulers at Rada, the crowds of thugs in helmets run riot in captured towns and on the roads, where they kill and rob. Shrewd masters told them about Bandera but forgot to tell about his end and the end of his adherents. They want to build the Great Ukraine in assistance of evil. But evil had been and will be punished! They know it and that's why hide their faces behind masks. But it won't save them! Today, while they celebrate their pseudo victory and loot in the captured towns, we, CyberBerkut, declare Right Sector outside the law! We declare hunting of neo-fascist criminals! They have no chance of escaping the punishment! Every will be responsible for their deeds! CyberBerkut will be hunting for fascist riffraff till their extermination like the inflexible Berkut have been staying till the end! Today we began to hack sites in order to shut the media lie up! We declare that we will defend Ukraine and save its history and the future of its people!!!
